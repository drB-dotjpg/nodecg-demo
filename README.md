# NodeCG Demo Bundle

This is a demo bundle for [NodeCG](https://www.nodecg.dev/) to feature some of it functions. It's made with HTML/CSS/JS to make it as easy as possible for all coders to reference and learn.

## Install

Keep in mind this is a *bundle* for NodeCG, so this repo is an entity to be added to NodeCG itself.

That means you should [install NodeCG](https://www.nodecg.dev/docs/installing) first! You will also need [Nodejs 18 or higher installed](https://nodejs.org/en).

Once all those are installed, navigate to the folder NodeCG is installed in then the `bundles` folder in the command line

Use command `git clone https://github.com/drB-dotjpg/nodecg-demo.git` to add the bundle

Next, use `cd nodecg-demo`

Finally, use `npm run start` to start the NodeCG server.
